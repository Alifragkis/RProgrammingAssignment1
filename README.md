This is an assignment which is part of the R Programming course delivered by Coursera [here.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/home)

More specifically, there are three different R functions, as follows

* pollutant.R which is a function that provides the mean number of given data
* complete.R which is a function that counts the number of complete cases of given data, by filtering out the missing values
* corr.R which is a function that calculates the correlation between two types of data based that are meet a specific threshold
